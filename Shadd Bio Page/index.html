      <!-- About Me -->

      <h2 id="aboutme">About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am Shadd, I am 52 years old and have been in IT or IT Project
        management for almost 20 years. I currently work for Liberty Mutual
        Insurance in the Investement Business Unit (LMI).
      </p>
      <p>
        I am the guy when people say jack of all trades master of none, my
        picture should be the reference. As hobbies I do custom motorcycle and
        automotive painting. I taught myself how to airbrush, I do leather
        working, and I take on one new big project every year to do over the
        winter. They can be from building a custom bobber motorcycle to doing
        custom paint jobs on mailboxes for all my family. I also dabble in 3d
        printing, minuture CNC wood working, and I build custom automatic
        watches.
      </p>
      <p>
        I took a MERN full-stack bootcamp through another company over a year
        ago but finished filling really unsatisfied so when I saw this course
        and had the opportunity I thought I'd give it a chance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally I love to travel I have been to Europe: Spain, and Ireland,
        Hawaii, Puerto Rico, USVI, Thialand, Mexico, and 49 of the 50 states
        only missing Alaska.
        <br /><br />
        I am also a dog lover and have one rescue dog Bella and an English
        Mastiff Bear.
